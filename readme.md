## Restaurant Page

Small project of a restaurant page based on The Odin Project's exercise

GitHub pages: // TODO

## Goals
1. Practice new workflow using webpack
2. Use tabs on a webpage 

## Things I practiced and learnt:
- Git Rebase. Did not have a need for that before, but I messed up setting up the environment and rebase helped me to fix it
- Webpack
  - modules
  - asset loaders
  - overall structure
  - How to bundle CSS
  - How to bundle Images
- Webpack-dev-server
  - Managed to figure out how to use hot reloading
  - Set up the workflow with IDE and non-default server. Took me quite some time
    - _The workflow is quite different to what I got used to, especially comparing to when I was doing Python stuff_
- Modular project structure
- Liked how I used dry and created basic functions to render all pages
- Git CLI
- Created my first issue reporting my IDE's bug on YouTrack
- Switch case
- More practice with events
