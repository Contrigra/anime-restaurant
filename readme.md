## Restaurant Page

Small project of a restaurant page based on The Odin Project's exercise

GitHub pages: // TODO

## Goals
1. Practice new workflow using webpack
2. Use tabs on a webpage 

## Things I practiced and learnt:
- Git Rebase. Haven't a need for that, but I messed up setting up the environment and rebase helped me to fix it
- TODO
